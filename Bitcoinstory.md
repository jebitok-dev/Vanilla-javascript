### scenarios from previous bitcoin owners or hodlers, how they acquired or if they ever sold their btc especially on lower prices stories picked from tweets on twitter.com
**scenario 1**: 
```
Hello boys I'm....from Venezuela. I'm a web application developer, 
I met bitcoin in 2016 when I had to immigrate to Argentina because I couldn't get medication for my daughter. 
I have a year working with python and data analysis.
I hope to catch up with the bitcoin code, thank you for the opportunity!
```
**Scenario 2**: 
"I wish I had kept my 1,700 BTC @ $0.06 instead of
selling them at $0.30, now that they're $8.00! 
#bitcoin" by https://twitter.com/gregschoen
 
**Scenario 3**: 
"I'm looking through some of my old bitcoin transactions 
and seriously regretting that time I paid my roommate 2 BTC
for that month's rent üòÖ" by https://twitter.com/ljxie

```
I kept the bitcoins you sent me! I have half the ether I got in 2016. 
I sold half to pay graduate school. Thank you for introducingme to crypto, Linda!
It's really helpful  to live with no student debt and have something that keeps growing! 
I only wishI had more gut back then to invest more) I'm super gratefulüòä
```
**Scenario 4**: 
"I KNOW EVERYONE KNOWS SOMEONE WITH A STORY LIKE THIS; BUT IN 2011 A GEEKY FRIEND AT WORK TOLD ME TO BUY BITCOIN (AT THAT STAGE IT WAS AROUND $0.50 PER COIN) AND I WAS SO CLOSE. CAN'T BELIEVE I MISSED THE OPPORTUNITY. 
THAT SAID I WOULD HAVE PROLLY LOST IT SOMEHOW." by https://twitter.com/KEENANMULVANEY
**Scenario 5**: 
"People were laughing on me in 2012 when I was buying $BTC under $15, instead of investing into stock market. I‚Äôm moving my #Bitcoin to $ZEC now. Can see some grins again. Will update the story in 2025 üëã #Zcash" by https://twitter.com/zcashmaximalist

**Scenario 6**: 
"In May 2019, [Russel Okung](https://twitter.com/RussellOkung) tweeted
```
"Pay me in Bitcoin."
```
Today, Okung has become the first player from any major US professional sports league to be paid in bitcoin.
Going forward, 
```
half of Okung's $13 million annual salary will be immediately converted to bitcoin.
```

**Scenario 7**: "$btc is a lifechanger!
Thanks [@bartroorda](https://twitter.com/bartroorda) for introducing me with Bitcoin. Thanks @bvanmaarseveen and @JeanneDeBit for teaching me..
What a ride down this rabbit hole üòÅüòÅ."
```
"[@bartroorda](https://twitter.com/bartroorda) introduced me with Steem end 2016. 
That lead to Bitcoin. It has been a wonderful ride with meetups by [@JeanneDeBit](https://twitter.com/JeanneDeBit) and [@bvanmaarseveen](@bvanmaarseveen). 
It teached me about new opportunities and personal finance. 
Really grateful for these life changes. üôå "
