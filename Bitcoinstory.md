### scenarios from previous bitcoin owners or hodlers, how they acquired or if they ever sold their btc especially on lower prices stories picked from tweets on twitter.com
**scenario 1**: 
```
Hello boys I'm....from Venezuela. I'm a web application developer, 
I met bitcoin in 2016 when I had to immigrate to Argentina because I couldn't get medication for my daughter. 
I have a year working with python and data analysis.
I hope to catch up with the bitcoin code, thank you for the opportunity!
